# orcid-wrapper
This Python wrapper for the ORCID Public API v1.2 has been developed for the SHARE Curation Associates group working to integrate selected ORCID data into SHARE Notify. It presupposes that Python 3, Jupyter Notebook, Requests and JSON dependencies have been met. Understand that only ORCID profiles in the public (production) server with visibility set to "public" can be captured by these queries.
